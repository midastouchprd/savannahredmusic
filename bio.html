                    <p> “I want to sing and it doesn’t matter if my passion drives me into the ground – I’m still gonna go down holding my notes,” says Anslee Connell, singer and songwriter from the Home of Statesboro Blues, currently living and making tunes
                        in the Live Music Capital, Austin, Texas. She sings under the stage name Savannah Red, a nod to her Deep Southern roots, as she makes quite the re-entrance onto the music scene after a hiatus in the fashion industry.</p>

                    </div>


                    <p> As a little one, Anslee daydreamed of being a singer one day, and she kept that dream alive against all odds and self-inflicted fears. She grew up singing in choirs at school, at church, and in youth chorales, but it wasn’t until her
                        dad threw an annual music festival in their 2.5-acre backyard in Statesboro, Georgia, that she got to do what she wanted to do most: sing with a band. That band comprised of her dad on bass, her mom on tambourine, her oldest brother
                        on guitar, and her other brother on drums, and they were known as Big Daddy & the Fireant Blues Band.</p>

                    <p> From the first moment she opened her mouth to the last note, Anslee never felt so alive. At the ripe age of 13, she knew with all of her being that she was meant to be a singer. In addition to singing, Anslee is an artist, through
                        and through, and has dabbled in multiple media including paper and bookmaking, writing and blogging, photography, painting, and clothing design and manufacturing, her biggest success apart from singing. “I kept being drawn back
                        to music no matter what I did. It was always in the back of my mind. I would practice songs that I loved or make up little rhymes for study notes to get me through a test or for house chores, sometimes even about dresses I was
                        making,” she laughs, now that she has transitioned into pursuing music as a full-time career after 6 years of fashion design. </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        “This – music – is my first love, the first love I could never get over.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Anslee identifies mainly as a jazz and blues singer, and beams about the honor of being able to sing for the late, great Ben Tucker of Savannah, Georgia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Being able to sing with Ben Tucker was a dream come true, and I am so fortunate to have had the opportunity to be in the presence of such a jazz legend,” she says about Tucker. “He told me that I needed to find a keyboard player and keep going,” and
                        that’s exactly what she’s done. For years, she was known strictly as a cover singer, daringly taking on the likes of Billie Holiday, Amy Winehouse, Patsy Cline, and Alison Krauss. Now, Anslee infuses those inspirations into her
                        original work, sometimes creating fun mash-ups everyone can get into.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “When she sings, she sounds like home...after all, isn’t that where your heart is?" ~ <i>Andre Mikhail of 'SceneCheck'
                              and 'Lucid Venture Media'</i>.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As a songwriter, from happy, light hearted songs of dropping everything you’re doing and going on an adventure to sexy, sultry blues riffs about steamy intimate encounters to denying your fears to follow your dreams, Anslee knows the
                        art of truly engaging her listener – or she grabs it for herself if you’re not paying attention! A natural-born entertainer, she lights up the stage from bars to reception halls with an unspeakable presence, one you must experience
                        for yourself. </p>
